    Monuments of Thailand
Thailand has a rich cultural heritage and that can be amply seen through the numerous monuments that are spread all through the country. Many of the famous landmarks are known all through the world, but as you walk about you will also spot smaller, lesser-known, but just as beautiful structures that have stood the ravages of time. When in Thailand, you must include Prasat Hin Phimai, one of the oldest temple structures, in your itinerary. Military history talks about the Bridge over River Kwai, and you can take a train or walk across this tragic reminder of the cost of war. The White Temple, James Bond Island, Sukhotai Historical Park and Temple of Dawn are all landmarks that will showcase the beauty of Thailand and let you know why it attracts tourists every year. Be careful about your attire when you visit religious places. Cover your shoulders and legs as it is considered inauspicious.

 

Natural beauty of Thailand
About 25% of Thailand is covered with natural forests such as monsoon and rainforests. These are mostly made of hardwood trees. Throughout the country, you will come across bamboo and coconut palms as well. Thailand has done an excellent job preserving its natural landscape, and there are numerous national parks throughout. You can trek through the forests, a few of which offer opportunities to climb high peaks, or bathe under beautiful waterfalls, or even get a glimpse of a dolphin. If you wish, you can head out to the coast and just laze by the beach with a book in your hand. Thailand also has several water sports, and if you are an adrenaline junkie, do check out some of the sports like snorkelling, diving and surfing while in Thialand.
